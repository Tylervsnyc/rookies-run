# Rookie's Revenge — pair synergy report

Generated 2026-10-08 by `scripts/run-playtest/combo-discover.ts`.

## Combo-gating is KIT-relative (the finding that reshaped this search)

The first pass tested "no single ability out of all 23 solves it" and accepted **0 of the 20 shipped Moat + Colonnade levels** — including the ones we know are combo gates. The measurement was right; the definition was wrong.

`bishop-step`, `knight-hop` and `become-king` are **universal solvents**: they change what Rookie's movement geometry *is* (or make her uncapturable), so they cross any terrain. A level whose difficulty is a terrain signature — a moat, a colonnade, a pen — can essentially never be gated against the full 23. Big summons (`dragon`, `duchess`, `vanguard`) behave the same way on many boards.

The Colonnade *is* gated — against its own kit. `runs.ts` gives it `allowedAbilities: [swap, bishop-squire, magnet, boulder]`, and that is every card the player can ever hold there. So the definition used here is:

> Given a 4-card **kit** K: no-ability <= 8%, every single card in K <= 8%, and at least one **pair** drawn from K inside 60-80% (the ceiling proves the level is HARD, not just that the pair is REQUIRED — spec.ts).

A level gated under MANY kits is more valuable (it can ship in several runs); within one kit, fewer winning pairs is better. A level that also survives every single card in the game is marked `pure` — a bonus tier, never required.

Card pool searched: **23 abilities** → 253 possible pairs. All 23 built abilities → 253 pairs.

Subjects screened: **2688** · combo-gated: **114** · solvable with no ability: 73 · every kit disqualified by one of its own cards: 1859 · a kit survived but no pair cleared: 535 · failed the high-trial confirm: 107

## Pairs played against a surviving kit that never gated a level

Real signal: a pair that has been played on several surviving levels and never gated one is a WEAK partnership, not just an untested one.

## Untested pairs

26 of 253 pairs have never been played against a surviving candidate. Widen with `--max-kits`, or extend `data/run-playtest/pair-hypotheses.json` to reorder the head of the search.

`_scans/` holds the full measured row for every subject scored with `--score-all` (the shipped-run ground truth); `_ledger.jsonl` is the resume ledger.
